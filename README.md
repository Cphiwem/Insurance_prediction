Analysing Insurance DataSets

This analysis explores insurance datasets with a primary focus on the 'charges' column. Our goal is to identify patterns, trends, 
and factors that influence insurance. Additionally, we will develop and evaluate predictive models to accurately forecast charges 
based on various demographic and health-related features. This comprehensive approach will provide actionable insights
for optimizing pricing strategies and enhancing decision-making in the insurance industry.
